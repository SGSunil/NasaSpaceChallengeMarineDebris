How to go through the project, first read the project objectives on Nasa Space Challenge Page - https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/leveraging-aiml-for-plastic-marine-debris/details

Thes read the scope document to learn how we planned when we started the project when there was no clarity of the data and with learning we improved the document.

The you can see the presentation to learn the different details, challenges, future plan.

Then proceed to Data Analysis part to learn how we did the data analysis.
